# Learning Laravel

Hello everyone, my name's Og.  
I'm learning about the Laravel Framework and I decided to share my new study project!
I  decided to learn about Laravel in an old version (V7). After that, I'll learn about the most recent versions. 
The focus of this project is working with forms. 
The Back End needs to perform some validations and save data in the database.
